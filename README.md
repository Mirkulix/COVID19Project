# COVID19Project

The project is part of a coursework at the LPU in India. The course has the topic "Covid 19 prediction using machine learning". 

The paper is in alpha state and describes the thoughts and the process of how to deal with the requirements. Here the focus is on the handling of data and its processing. As the JP Notebook shows some mechanisms are necessary to generate the right data for a prediction. 

It describes my journey into the topic "ML/DL" it is a beginning for more.

Datasets:

The Project contains different data sets so that different requirements can be shown. The data sets have the status Cleaned and roughly prepared.
